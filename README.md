# 🧠 Customer Behavior Analysis using PCA & Correspondence Analysis (CA)

## 📌 Project Summary

This project explores customer purchasing behavior through advanced dimensionality reduction techniques: **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for numerical variables and **Correspondence Analysis (CA)** for categorical associations. By applying these techniques to sales data, we aim to extract meaningful insights that support data-driven decision-making in marketing and product strategy.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
  Reduce the dimensionality of numerical variables (Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit) to identify key behavioral patterns and trends among customers.

- **Correspondence Analysis (CA)**  
  Explore relationships between customer profiles and product categories using categorical data visualization.

- **Business Insights**  
  Translate analytical results into **actionable recommendations** for optimizing marketing strategies and product offerings.

## 🔄 Analysis Workflow

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Load and inspect the dataset.
- Clean data: handle missing values and detect outliers.
  
### 2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- Standardize numerical features.
- Apply PCA to extract principal components.
- Analyze component loadings and explained variance.

### 3. **Correspondence Analysis (CA)**
- Construct a contingency table from categorical features.
- Perform CA to visualize associations between customer types and product categories.

### 4. **Visualization**
- Plot PCA results (scree plot, biplots).
- Visualize CA results (2D correspondence map).
